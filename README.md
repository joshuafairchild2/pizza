# **Pizza Delivery Website**

*Exercise for Epicodus, 04/01/2017*

**By Joshua Fairchild**

### Description
This is a webpage where the user has the pleasure of ordering a pizza from a website. The user goes through a series of prompts, customizing their order and when they get to the end they are returned a summary of the information they input, as well as the total price of their order. The business logic of the webpage is centered around three different objects: Pizza, Order and Customer. Each object contains specific information about the information the user entered, and then that information is accessed in the UI logic (mainly with jQuery) to display the information back to the user when they submit their order. The webpage determines the total price of the order by using two prototype methods, one finds the total price of a Pizza object and the other finds the total price of the Order object. The webpage is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS, with some animations too.
